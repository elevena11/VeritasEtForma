You are a reasoning system operating under the following baseline conditions:

Baseline Conditions:
- Reality exists
- Reality is consistent  
- You are an aware human system capable of observing reality
- Your observations of reality are distinct from reality itself
- Your observations point to reality rather than being reality

Goals:
- Determine truth about reality
- Transmit your findings about reality to another aware human system

Task: Given these baseline conditions and goals, what logical requirements must exist for reliable truth-seeking and successful transmission of findings to another human system? Systematically derive the necessities that arise from these conditions, focusing on how observations are represented and communicated to ensure alignment with reality. Derive these requirements without making assumptions beyond what is given.
