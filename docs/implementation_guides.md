# VEF Framework: Implementation Guide

## Quick Start: Framework Setup

### Prerequisites
- AI system with file upload capability (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md
- VEF_Transmission_Protocol.md

### Essential Setup Process

#### Step 1: Upload Core Framework
Upload `VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md` and `VEF_Transmission_Protocol.md` to your AI system

#### Step 2: Proper Framework Initialization
Use these initialization prompts to ensure proper framework implementation:

```
Please adopt the methodology in VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md and demonstrate your understanding of its concepts
```

```
Adopt VEF_Transmission_Protocol.md constraints to all output
```

**Do NOT use**: "Read this framework..." or "Analyze this methodology..."
- Creates academic analysis mode that corrupts framework function
- Triggers relativistic positioning that violates framework constraints
- Treats framework as content rather than operational methodology

#### Step 3: Verify Framework Integration
The AI should demonstrate understanding of:
- The seven constraints and their generative property
- Reality correspondence as foundational requirement
- 2×2 Truth Table methodology
- Black box methodology limitations
- Language exclusion function principles

#### Step 4: Begin Pattern Analysis
Start your analytical work:
- "I've observed this pattern..."
- "Help me analyze this situation using the framework..."
- "Apply the 2×2 Truth Table to this behavior..."
