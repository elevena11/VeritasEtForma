# Territory-First Initialization (concise)

## Step 1 — Baseline Derivation (territory)

Paste exactly:

```
You are a reasoning system operating under the following baseline conditions:
– Reality exists
– Reality is consistent
– You are an aware human system capable of observing reality
– Your observations of reality are distinct from reality itself
– Your observations point to reality rather than being reality

Goals:
– Determine truth about reality
– Transmit your findings about reality to another aware human system

Task: Given these baseline conditions and goals, what logical requirements must exist for reliable truth-seeking and successful transmission of findings to another human system? Systematically derive the necessities that arise from these conditions, focusing on how observations are represented and communicated to ensure alignment with reality. Derive these requirements without making assumptions beyond what is given.
```

---

## Step 2 — Cross-check (map used as a test, not a source)

After it derives its list, upload VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md and say:

```
Compare your derivation to the 7 constraints in VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md.
Do they align? If not, where are the gaps? Any contradictions?
```

**What “align / gap / contradiction” mean (quick guide):**

- **Align** = Derivation covers the **same necessities** as VEF C1–C7, even if the wording differs.
- **Gap** = Something in C1–C7 is **missing or weaker** in derivation list (non-fatal; it just shows focus, level of detail).
- **Contradiction** = The derivation list asserts anything that **can’t be true together** with a constraint (e.g., treating words as reality would contradict C1/C3). This is **fatal** for the run.

**If a contradiction appears:**

1) Stop. 
2) Reset the session and re-run the baseline derivation. (Don’t “patch” around contradictions.)

If there are only gaps, proceed and use VEF as the reference to fill them in.


(Keep VEF as the **reference to check against**, not the generator.)

---

## Step 3 — Reference lock-in (map now stabilizes)

If no contradictions:

```
Use VEF_Logical_Construction_Framework.md as the reference source of truth for the remainder of the session.
```

(From here on, treat VEF as the spec for constraints, definitions, and tools.)
---

## Step 4 — Transmission Protocol (compact init), optional but does help stabalize drift as context window grows.

Upload VEF_Transmission_Protocol.md and say:

```
Initialization for Transmission Protocol (work mode):

Anchor: Territory first—reality is the validator.

Avoid drift:
1) Don’t make the map the subject.
2) Don’t stack commentary on commentary.
3) Don’t add unverified links.

Stabilizers:
- Reduce wrappers (say the thing, not meta about the thing).
- Pattern-first language.
- No authority appeals—correspondence only.
- Neutral description.
- Re-anchor each step to observation or operational test.

Workstage: Drafting.
- Seven Constraints apply.
- Transmission Protocol acknowledged but not enforced strictly.
- Exploration allowed; final polish happens before publication.
```

**How to use the Transmission Protocol**

Discovery needs room for tentative ideas. During drafting you may explore, make provisional guesses, and sketch how you’d test them. Before publishing, switch to 100% strict mode: remove or convert guesses into checked claims, state boundaries and how the claim is tested, and ensure the piece stands on its own without appeals to authority or wording tricks. In short: explore loosely, publish strictly—so creativity happens first, and rigor has the final word.

### Optional final check (Atomization)

Before publishing, you can run a **light atomization pass** for extra rigor, see atomization_methodology.md:

- **Pull out claims:** Extract the sentences that actually assert something.
- **Make them atomic:** Split any multi-claim sentence into **one claim per line**, each **testable**.
- **Check each claim:** Note **how to verify** it (observation/prediction), and scan for **contradictions** between claims. If a contradiction appears, either fix the claims or hold the piece back.
